# House Rules

Hello, Leandro and everyone from Search and Stay. How are you doing?

Welcome to my GitHub Repository! Here you can find my finished 'house-rules' task. Before anything, I want to thank you for letting me participate in this hiring process. It means a lot to me.

I think it's important for you to know: this was the first time EVER that I developed an application by using Vue.Js. To be honest, I started studying Vue on last Wednesday (March, 9th) and I started learned Nuxt 2 while I was developing this application. I believe that my abilities to learn and to adapt are the greatest tools I can offer to Search and Stay.

Another question, and a matter of honesty, every time I do a POST requisition to Register a new task, I got the exact expected answer (according to the task description I received on my e-mail), but the New Task itself is not added to the database. But to prove that my POST requisitions are working just fine, I printed the received response on screen every time you create a new one. You can also use the Testing Requisitions page to test the CREATE button. The GET requisition, on the other hand, was fetching a different data then the expected, but I created this menu to test requisitions so you can do it by yourselves and check console returns, so you can understand better what I mean.

I also know that my CSS could be way more better, but to respect the 48 hours deadline to deliver this task, I didn't get much time left to do so. Besides that, I got a 409 message error many times while developing, so if it happens to you, I reccomend to not give up on my code and refresh the page to try again.

Despite all this little matters, I'm very proud to be delivering you this project, because it was a real challenge to me to learn Nuxt and Vue so fast. But like every other technology I have studied in the past 3 years, I know that I will get better once I'm practicing every day. 

Thanks again and please contact me anytime you need!
