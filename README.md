# House Rules

Hello, Leandro and everyone from Search and Stay. How are you doing?

Welcome to my GitHub Repository! Here you can find my finished 'house-rules' task. Before anything, I want to thank you for letting me participate in this hiring process. It means a lot to me.

I think it's important for you to know: this was the first time EVER that I developed an application with Vue.Js and Nuxt 2. To be honest, I started studying Vue on last Wednesday (March, 9th) and I started learned Nuxt 2 while I was developing this application. I believe that my abilities to learn and to adapt are the greatest tools I can offer to Search and Stay.

Another question, and a matter of honesty, every time I do a POST requisition to Register a new task, I got the exact expected answer (according to the task description I received on my e-mail), but the New Task itself is not added to the database. But to prove that my POST requisitions are working just fine, I printed the received response on screen every time you create a new one. You can also use the Testing Requisitions page to test the CREATE button. The GET requisition, on the other hand, was fetching a different data then the expected, but that's another reason why I created this menu to test requisitions - so you can do it by yourselves and check the console returns, so you can understand better what I mean.

I also know that my CSS could be way more better, but to respect the 48 hours deadline to deliver this task, I didn't get much time left to do so. Besides that, I got a 409 message error many times while developing, so if it happens to you, I reccomend to not give up on my code and refresh the page to try again.

Despite all this little matters, I'm very proud to be delivering you this project, because it was a real challenge to me to learn Nuxt and Vue so fast. But like every other technology I've studied in the past 3 years, I believe myself quite capable of getting better every day once I'm practicing daily. 

Here is a project preview:
## HOME PAGE
The first page fetch data from the API to build the cards.

Thanks again and please contact me anytime you need!

---
## TESTING REQUESTS
And the last page contains 5 buttons to test the 5 requests and check the return in the console.

And the last topic, as I said, I'm a new Vue and Nuxt user, and I didn't understand why the /nuxt folder wasn't updated to GitHub. In case you need the application ROUTES, please ask me so I can send you the routes.js file.

Feel free to contact me anytime! Thank you!
